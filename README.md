## Simple frontend application to gather data from API, that connects to https://www.brewerydb.com .

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GeorgeFourikis/Brewery.git
cd Brewery
npm i
npm start
```

## In order to make this React application work, we need to also have our *brewery-proxy* API running.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GeorgeFourikis/Brewery_Proxy_Backend.git
```
